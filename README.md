# Object Detection Methods
A brief overview and comparison between two Object Detection Methods - spanning Weakly Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques. The methods explored in this work are:
- [Detic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02605)
- [CutLER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11320)

The batch object detection, visualization and evaluation codes and results are provided in the respective IPython notebooks.
